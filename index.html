            <p>
                When it comes to advancing my knowledge in computer science, I've adopted a structured learning approach by adhering to the renowned MIT curriculum. 
                This curriculum offers a thorough and demanding education in various facets of computer science, including science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. 
                To delve into these subjects, my primary reliance is on MIT OpenCourseWareâ€”an invaluable resource providing free access to an extensive array of MIT course 
                content. This includes lecture notes, assignments, exams, and other materials crucial for maintaining my focus and gaining a deeper understanding of the material.
                <br>
                For skill enhancement and acquiring proficiency in widely used technologies, I complement my MIT curriculum studies with online courses. Platforms like 
                Udemy offer a diverse range of courses that enable me to stay updated on the latest industry trends and build practical skills relevant to the market. 
                This structured learning approach, combined with MIT's rigorous curriculum and supplementary online courses, forms the foundation of my comprehensive 
                education in computer science.

                            <p>This project involved developing a word game in Python using a <strong>dictionary</strong>. 
                                The game presents users with a series of letters and challenges them to create as 
                                many valid words as possible using those letters.
                            </p>

            <img  id="cpu" src="./resources/images/computer.jpg">
            <p>In my MIT 6.004 computer architecture course, I took on the challenge of creating a CPU from basic principles. Starting with the basics of bit encoding, 
                I worked through MOSFETs, combinational and sequential logic, and finite state machines. I pieced together a CPU step by step, 
                turning abstract concepts into a functional unit. This hands-on project not only improved my technical skills but also deepened my understanding of 
                computing systems. From binary basics to a custom CPU, it's been an exciting journey of learning and creating.
