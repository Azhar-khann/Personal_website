                <strong>Welcome to my corner of the internet!</strong> <br>
                <p>I'm a passionate self-learner who's always had a deep curiosity 
                about the world around us. With a particular interest in STEM fields, I've embarked on a journey of 
                continuous learning, exploring new topics and expanding my knowledge base.</p>

            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>
                Hello and welcome to my website! My name is Azhar, and I'm an independent learner with a passion for STEM fields. 
                I've always been fascinated by the way the world works, and I love exploring new concepts and ideas in science, 
                technology, engineering, and mathematics.

                I'm particularly interested in physics, computer science, math and bit of electrical engineering, and I've spent a 
                lot of time diving deep into these subjects. I find the laws of physics to be endlessly fascinating, 
                from the fundamental principles of mechanics to the complexities of quantum mechanics. In computer science, 
                I love exploring the ways that machines can be used to solve problems and make our lives easier. And in math, I enjoy 
                the challenge of working with abstract concepts and discovering new patterns and relationships and the fact that 
                you can actually "Prove" something that cannot be dsiputed.

                While my interests are broad, I do sometimes focus more on one subject than another. For example, 
                I might spend a few weeks or months exploring a particular topic in physics or I might immerse myself in a coding project and 
                spend hours tweaking the code to make it just right. This flexibility allows me to follow my interests wherever 
                they take me and to learn in a way that's truly personalized to my needs.<br><br>
                
                In addition to my love for STEM, I'm also passionate and make sure that i acquire new skills. I enjoy learning new 
                programming languages and working on web development projects. 
                I find that the process of learning and applying these skills is both challenging and rewarding, 
                and it helps me to develop a more nuanced understanding of how STEM concepts can be applied in the real world.

            <p>
                When it comes to learning about STEM subjects, I've found that having a structured approach is key. 
                That's why I've chosen to follow the MIT curriculum for each of these subjects. The MIT curriculum provides a 
                comprehensive and rigorous education in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, which is exactly what I was 
                looking for.
                To study these subjects, I rely heavily on MIT OpenCourseWare, a free and open digital publication of virtually all 
                MIT course content. This resource provides me with access to lecture notes, assignments, exams, and other 
                course materials that help me stay on track and understand the material more deeply. 
                In addition to MIT OpenCourseWare, I also use textbooks to supplement my learning.
                By combining these resources and following the MIT curriculum, I've been able to create a structured and 
                effective path towards achieving my goals in STEM fields.
